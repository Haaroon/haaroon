I work as a Quant at Blockchain.com. Before this I worked in research at [Pometry](https://www.pometry.com), a startup I co-founded in 2021, with 
my colleague [Ben Steer](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=JaCvFD8AAAAJ&hl=en) and Hamza Alnaimi from Queen Mary. Our 
specialty is distributed temporal graph analytics, since most platforms are either too slow or 
cannot perform this kind of analysis. Come say hello. 

Prior to this I graduated with a [Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) 
[PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy) from
the [Information Security Group](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) at
[UCL (University College London)](http://www.ucl.ac.uk). 
Where I researched Investigating transactions in cryptocurrencies under the supervision 
of [Professor Sarah Meiklejohn](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Meiklejohn/) and
[Professor Jens Groth](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/j.groth/), supported by 
the [EU 2020 project](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) and 
the [Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3)](http://www.initc3.org/).
