I am a fourth year [Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) 
[PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy) student in
the [Information Security Group](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) at
[UCL (University College London)](http://www.ucl.ac.uk). 
Researching Cryptocurrencies and Underground Markets under the supervision 
of [Professor Sarah Meiklejohn](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Meiklejohn/) and
[Professor Jens Groth](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/j.groth/), supported by 
the [EU 2020 project](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) and 
the [Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3)](http://www.initc3.org/).

In 2020 I also co-founded a small start-up called [Chorograph](https://www.chorograph.com) with 
my colleague [Ben Steer](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=JaCvFD8AAAAJ&hl=en) from Queen Mary. Our 
specialty is distributed temporal graph analytics, since most platforms are either too slow or 
cannot perform this kind of analysis. Come say hello.
